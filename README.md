## SQL Challenge: Employee Database

### Project Overview
Welcome to the SQL Challenge project! In this project, you'll be working on a research task for Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company. Your objective is to analyze employee data from the 1980s and 1990s using a series of CSV files that contain the remnants of the employee database from that period.

### 1. Data Modeling
- Inspect the CSV files located in the data/ directory.
- Sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the table structures and relationships.
- Save the ERD diagram as ERD.png in the diagrams/ directory.
### 2. Data Engineering
- Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files:
departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
- Define the appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints for each table.
- Ensure that primary keys are unique. If necessary, create composite keys.
- Create the tables in the correct order to handle foreign key constraints.
- Use the schema.sql file to define and create the tables in the database.
### 3. Data Analysis
- Import the CSV files into their corresponding SQL tables.
- Write SQL queries to answer questions about the data.
- Save the queries in the queries.sql file.

### Written Report
By grade level, both math and reading abilities showed consistent performance across all grades, with an average math score ranging from 78 to 79 and an average reading score of 81.

When analyzing the impact of spending ranges per student, it was observed that schools with lower spending per student tended to achieve higher academic performance. On the other hand, the size of the school did not appear to have a significant correlation with academic achievement.

When examining the data based on school type, Charter schools outperformed District schools significantly in terms of the overall passing percentage. Charter schools had an impressive 90.43% overall passing rate, while District schools lagged behind with a rate of 53.679%.

Cabrera High School emerged as the top-performing school with an outstanding 91.33% overall passing rate, while Rodriguez High School recorded the lowest performance at 52.99%. Interestingly, Cabrera High School is a Charter school with a per-student budget of $582, whereas Rodriguez High School falls under the District school category with a per-student budget of $637. These findings align with the overall trends observed across all schools in terms of school type and per-student budget.
