## SQL Challenge: Employee Database

### Project Overview
Welcome to the SQL Challenge project! In this project, you'll be working on a research task for Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company. Your objective is to analyze employee data from the 1980s and 1990s using a series of CSV files that contain the remnants of the employee database from that period.
